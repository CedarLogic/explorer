Set of colors.

<div class="header">Actions</div>
Drag a color to a graph to change its' base color.<br>
The other colors needed by the graph will be equally
distributed on the chromatic circle, starting from
this base color.<br>
For example if only two colors are needed (the graph
must display two categories) the second color will
be diametrically opposed to the base color.
